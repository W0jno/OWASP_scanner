## Technologies

- **Python** ‚Äì backend logic and APIs  
- **TypeScript**, **HTML**, **CSS** ‚Äì frontend user interface  
- **SQL** (e.g., PostgreSQL or SQLite) ‚Äì database  
- **Docker & Docker Compose** ‚Äì containerization

    docker-compose up --build
    ```

   This will start: 
   - The backend API  
   - The database
  
    For frontend go to the /fronted folder, then:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start:
   - The frontend

5. After startup:
   - Frontend available at: `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage

1. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.  
2. Enter the URL of the web application to be scanned.  
3. Wait for the scan to complete.  
4. View and explore the results in the dashboard.   
5. All scans are stored in the database for future access.
